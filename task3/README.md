# Let's Play Dice
## About the game
- It is a simple command line implementation of the Dice game that you can play against your computer.
- The Application uses probability extensively to make the game more "fair" and restrict the computer from "cheating".
- Dices have 6 faces (at least for now)!
  
Choose your dice and **BEAT** your Computer :)

GOOD LUCK!
